# Fondum

The **F**lask **O**Auth **N**GINX **D**ocker **U**nicorn **M**ongoDB super-framework.

*FONDUM* is a useful tool to generate web site projects.

It uses Flask, which is a tiny simple microframework. Then a large number of libraries and presumptive and complex requirements are added. In other words, it's not tiny anymore. The dictator of the fondum project pre-emptively decides what should be added. Such arrogance!

The following are the goals:

* Make it easy to _quickly_ create a functioning web site.
* Preemptively add a lot of functions that are not usually considered until much later as a project expands. Such as:
   * Multilingual translation and localization
   * Logging and Error Handling with integrated Flash messaging
   * Scalable image storage
   * Cloud distribution
   * Repository storage
* Splits implementation roles between IT/Ops and Developer.
   * IT/Ops folks do things that are complicated obscurely technical. Changes are made from a command-line shell. For example, generating the project's files, maintaining the URL routes, distributing docker containers, etc.
   * Developers do things with creative eye and skill. Changes are made from the live web. For example, writing content and uploading pictures.
* Emphasize _run-time_ performance not _compile-time_ performance. It is better to waste the programmer's time once than the public's time repeatedly. To wit:
   * Have the web site create tightly generated HTML5/CSS that requires little of the end-users browser and network connection.
   * Render and test as much as possible during compilation. (But not so much as to cause problem with the Developer.)
* Refrain from adding duplicative features.
   * Fondum should _not_ appeal to all people and use cases. (But if you want to add some extra bling, feel free to fork this project. It is open source after all.)
   * The include/exclude decision of the benevelan dictator is subjective and somewhat arbitrary.
   * For example, Fondum chooses to store images on Amazon S3. There are lots of many **good** alternatives to S3. But only one is chosen.

## Preparing To Use Fondum

1. If not already installed, install Python 2.7+ and Python 3.5+. Details vary by OS. (Fondum uses Python 3, Flask runs under Python 2.7)
2. If not already installed, install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/). 
3. If not already installed, install Fondum itself system-wide.

   ```
   me@machine ~ $ sudo pip3 install fondum
   ```

   Alternatively, install from the repo directly:

   ```
   me@machine ~ $ sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/JohnAD/fondum.git#egg=fondum
   ```


4. Change to the directory where you store your web projects. (Or, make such a directory.)

   ```
   me@machine ~ $ cd WebSites
   me@machine ~/WebSites $
   ```

5. If not already installed, install [docker](https://www.docker.com/). Details vary by OS.
6. If not already installed, install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Details vary by OS.

## Starting a Project with Fondum

1. Change to the directory where you store your web projects.
2. Invoke fondum to create your project. This will create a "dummy" website that is fully functional.

   ```
   me@machine ~/WebSites $ python3 fondum/create.py test
   ```

3. Enter the directory and build the docker containers.

   ```
   me@machine ~/WebSites $ cd test
   me@machine ~/WebSites/test $ sudo docker-compose build
   ```

4. Start the docker containers.

   ```
   me@machine ~/WebSites/test $ sudo docker-compose up
   ```

5. Test the new website! Browse to `http://127.0.0.1/`
6. When done testing, press `Ctrl+C` to stop docker.
7. Edit the files in `settings` and `custom` subdirectories to make the site the way you want.
8. Re-compile the site with fondum from the project root directory.

   ```
   me@machine ~/WebSites/test $ cd ..
   me@machine ~/WebSites $ python3 fondum/compile.py test --verbose
   ```

9. Go back step 4 until you are happy with the results.
10. Deploy the docker containers on your favorite cloud hosting service.

## List of Functions Beyond Flask

* Docker: a service that efficiently stores the project in "virtual machines". Used for both testing and deployment.
* MongoDB: a NoSQL database. Accessed via the MongoEngine library.
* Google OAuth2: an open authentication method. Allows users to login and create account with their Google accounts.
* Amazon S3: an object (file) storage service. It is where we keep most of the images.
* NGINX: the web server that serves the web pages to the public.
* Unicorn: a wrapper for flask used by NGINX in production environments.
* Creole: the `python-creole` library interprets the [creole](http://www.wikicreole.org/) text format. Used for safely formatting the live web content.


TBD:

* Babel/BabelFish: a library that handles multi-lingual internationalization. Creates and uses PO/POT translation files.
* SendGrid: a outbound SMTP messages service. Integrated with Msg (see below)
* some kind of traffic tracking
* compile-time compression of HTML5/CSS.


IN-BUILT (later to be made into standalone libraries):

* Msg: a service that generically returns "responses". Used in multiple ways: generates logs, web flash messages, and python function responses.
* Page: a page description class that goes WAY beyond what Flask-WTF does. Generates forms, tables, and almost all page content.
